## Music Preprocessing
### Mel-spectrogram (Input for Deep Learning)
  * Audio data is very high-dimensional and comes from a mixture of frequencies.
#### Step 1. Windowing (framing)
  * Audio is sequential and time dependent.
  * Dividing the signal into very short sections that allow time-invariant assumptions.
