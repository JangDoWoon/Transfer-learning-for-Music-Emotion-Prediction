## Music Preprocessing
### Mel-spectrogram (Input for Deep Learning)
  * Audio data is very high-dimensional and comes from a mixture of frequencies.
#### Step 1. Windowing (framing)
  * Audio is sequential and time dependent.
  * Dividing the signal into very short sections that allow time-invariant assumptions.

#### Step 2. Short Time Fourier Transform
 * Fourier Transfrom
  * It translates the waveform from time domain to frequency domain.
